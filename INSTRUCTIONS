This code is based on our R code but also uses the Jazzy Tool developed by Eike Caldeweyher and Gian Marco Ghiandoni in AstraZeneca (see https://github.com/AstraZeneca/jazzy for details)

This first version only works for monobasic or monoacid compounds. 

1. Once Jazzy is installed on your computers, calculate Jazzy descriptors using the script 'jazzy_descriptors_v3.sh'

bash jazzy_descriptors_v3.sh "desired name" "yourcompouds.csv"

The csv called "yourcompouds.csv" in the first column must have the id (name or id of your molecules) and in the second column the smiles of your compounds

1. In the R environment, download our dataset 'logD_final.xlsx'

2.  Set the location where the database was downloaded as a working directory 

3. If your terminal does not have the required packages, install:
install.packages('rJava')
install.packages('rcdk')
install.packages('readxl')
install.packages('caret')
install.packages('dplyr')
install.packages('ggplot2')
install.packages('Metrics')
install.packages('bestglm')
install.packages('pROC')
install.packages('glmnet')
install.packages('randomForest')
install.packages('e1071')

4. Run the script, thus the training and test set for all ML algorithms are ready.

5. Create a .xlsx file called "test.xlsx" that has the following columns:

Column 1 = SMILES: Use the canonical SMILES Code for each molecule 
Column 2 =  type (acid or base) #here you must separate acids from bases
Column 3 = pKa #it can be calculated with ChemAxon in case experimental values are not available) 
Column 4 =  pH # The desired pH at which you want to classificate your molecule

6. Predictions from all models will be communicated and stored in the file "results_ML.xlsx"
